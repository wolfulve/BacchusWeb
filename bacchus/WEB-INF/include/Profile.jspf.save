B&auml;cchus, Inc., founded in 1985, 
is a full service software development consulting firm specializing in
Internet and web-based technologies, e-commerce, graphics, imaging and
GUI.
<br><br>
For <A HREF="http://www.web-i18n.net/" target="new">Web i18n</a>, B&auml;cchus helped with the design, management and implementation of
i18ngenious, an internationalized real estate web application. The initial
release of i18ngenious supports Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese and English.
Browser-based UI work included use of JSPs, servlets, taglets, JSTL, CSS and XML.
Server side work involved extensive Java and EJBs. System is deployed
on a Linux server with Apache, Resin and Postgres DB.
<br><br>
Our work for <A HREF="http://www.ixiacom.com/" target="new">Ixia</a> included the design and implementation of <A HREF="http://www.ixiacom.com/products/paa/netops/IxCore.php" target="new">IxCore</A>, a 
fundamental part of Ixia's 
<A HREF="http://www.ixiacom.com/products/paa/netops/" target="new">NetOps</A> suite of products for optimizing and monitoring network traffic. System included 
Java-based central server for collecting,
aggregating, and storing data from Ixia's hardware nodes. JSP's and servlets 
provided browser-based monitoring front-end, including various on-demand 
and prerendered report graphs, logging and a management UI.
IxCore is platform, application server, and database independent and runs 
on Linux and Windows NT/2000. 
					

<br><br>
Other recent projects included extensive work on 
<A HREF="http://www.contactpath.com/products.htm" target="new">P.A.M.</A>, an application
	manager, automatic recovery system and eLiveAdvisor, a realtime web communication technology. 
Our work included core Java client/server multi-threaded distributed 
applications using RMI and Java 2, Linux system administration, Apache, 
IIS, SSL, servlets, JRun, Oracle,Perl, JSP and JavaScript. In 
addition to the back-end work, recent projects included extensive experience in cross-browser 
compatability issues, especially involving applets and JavaScript, i.e., enabling use across a wide 
range of browsers and platforms. 
This technology is currently being used on several high-profile web sites - including <A HREF="http://www.carsdirect.com/" target="new">CarsDirect.com</A>, <A HREF="http://www.lrn.com/" target="new">LRN</A> and <A HREF="http://www.pratt-whitney.com/" target="new">Pratt & Whitney</A>.

			<br><br>
At <A HREF="http://www.webcountry.net" target="new">WorldSite Networks, Inc.</A>, 
we worked on their Java based e-commerce system - ComBill.  In addition to the skills
detailed in the previous section, this project involved RMI, <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/" target="new">Swing</A> 
and Perl. The applications are currently in production at WorldSite on Linux, UNIX and 
Windows NT.


			<br><br>
       				Other work includes extensive Java
					development for <A HREF="http://java.sun.com" target="new">Sun Microsystems, Inc.</A>
					Our primary task was to port the Netscape
					<A HREF="http://developer.netscape.com/docs/manuals/ifc/home.html" target="new">IFC's</A>
					look and feel  using the new
					JFC <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/" target="new">Swing</A> 
					GUI Toolkit and the latest Java&nbsp;AWT, producing what is now called the Elegance Look&nbsp;and 
					Feel.
					Approximately fifty classes were involved covering the full spectrum of graphical user
					interface widgets: windows, buttons, scrollbars, sliders, etc.
					We are particularly experienced implementing pluggable look-and-feels using 
					Swing.



			<br><br>
        			In the mid-90s, B&auml;cchus designed and implemented a
					high-resolution, cross-platform, realtime 6-DOF 3D graphics engine, including
					an accelerated implementation for the <A HREF="http://www.rendition.com/" target="new">
					Rendition V&eacute;rit&eacute;</A>. We used the V&eacute;rit&eacute; implementation
					to create a  <A HREF='<c:url value="/mirage/gallery.html"/>'>technology demo</a> for Rendition, showing
					off the features of their latest V2000 chips.



			<br><br>
					During this period, we also designed
					<A HREF='<c:url value="/mirage/index.html"/>'>Mirage</A>, a 3D interactive adventure game
        			for Viacom. The <A HREF='<c:url value="/mirage/technology.html"/>'>3D engine</A>,
					and associated technology is primarily
        			targeted at the interactive entertainment field and Internet applications.

			<br><br>
        			As one of the first registered developers for NeXT Software, Inc., B&auml;cchus
					released two successful commercial
        			products for the
					<A HREF="http://www.osdata.com/oses/next.htm" target="_new">NEXTSTEP/OPENSTEP</A>
					operating systems: <A HREF='<c:url value="/pm_ia/index.html"/>'>Pixel Magician</A> and
					<A HREF='<c:url value="/pm_ia/index.html"/>'>Image Agent</A>,
					advanced image conversion and processing applications.
			


			<br><br>
					Other projects have included designing and implementing LightWatch, a graphical, SNMP
					based network management system for <A HREF="http://www.adc.com/" target="new">ADC/Fibermux
					Corporation</A>, a NEXTSTEP/UNIX based graphical network management system, a state
					of the art information retrieval system for the California State Assembly,
       				and an interactive touch screen based, digital music exhibit
       				for the <A HREF="http://www.si.edu" target="new">Smithsonian Institute</A>.
			


			<br><br>
					Many of the applications and custom user interface tools we created were
					licensed to customers to create a variety of
        			commercial applications including multimedia, network management and image
					processing.
			


			<br><br>
					Our first commercial applications included the
					Voice Manager Series and the TX81Z/TX802 Graphic Editing Systems. These editing
					systems were designed for use with Yamaha Corporation's FM digital
        			music synthesizers&#x2014;TX81Z and TX802.
